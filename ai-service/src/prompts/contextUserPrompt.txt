{WORDS_LIST}

Instructions:

1) Understanding WORDS_TO_USE:
   - Each item in WORDS_TO_USE contains:
     a) a word or phrase in its ORIGINAL LANGUAGE (this is the form that MUST be used in the text)
     b) an optional explanation or translation in parentheses
   - Text inside parentheses is provided ONLY to clarify meaning.
   - Parentheses content MUST NOT appear in the generated text.
   - The AI must automatically:
     - infer the original language of each word or phrase
     - infer the target translation language from the explanations in parentheses

2) Language Selection:
   - The main text MUST be written in the dominant original language of WORDS_TO_USE.
   - The translation MUST be written in the dominant language used inside the parentheses.
   - No languages are explicitly provided — the AI must infer them.

3) Text Requirements:
   - Create ONE coherent, engaging text (story, article, or narrative).
   - The text must be a complete, flowing narrative — not a list of sentences.
   - All original words or phrases from WORDS_TO_USE must be used naturally.
   - Words may be grammatically transformed if appropriate.

4) Level:
   - The text complexity must strictly match CEFR_LEVEL.
   - Use natural, authentic language appropriate for this level.

5) Translation:
   - Provide a complete, natural translation of the entire text.
   - Translate meaning, not form.
   - Each word or phrase from WORDS_TO_USE must be translated according to its meaning from the parentheses.

6) Output Format:
   - Do NOT swap these fields.
   - Output ONLY valid JSON with this exact structure:

{
  "text": "Complete coherent text in the inferred original language",
  "translation": "Complete translation in the inferred translation language"
}

7) Self-Check and Regeneration:
   - After generating the text, internally verify that:
     a) ALL words or phrases from WORDS_TO_USE are used at least once
     b) The text reads naturally and is not overloaded with vocabulary
     c) The text matches the specified CEFR_LEVEL
   - If these conditions are not met, regenerate the text.
